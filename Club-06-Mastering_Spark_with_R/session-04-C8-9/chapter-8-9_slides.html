# Intro, Set up, Analysis

* **Spark**: A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
* **Set up**:  `sc &lt;- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3")`
* **Analysis**: `sparklyr` integrates with many R like `dplyr`, `magrittr`, `broom`, `DBI`, `tibble`, `rlang`, and many others

&lt;br&gt;

* However, you cannot use the standard R models. Spark has a large library of modeling commands `MLlib`. 

---

# Data Handling

Beyond big data and big compute, you can also use Spark to improve data:
.large[
* Velocity
* Variety
* Veracity
]

.large[
Data management shift from normalizing all data into centralized databases and/or data warehouses to embracing variety of data managed as data lake.
]

.large[
**=&gt; You  can use Spark to unify data processing from data lakes, databases, and data warehouses through a single interface that is scalable across all of these solutions** 
]

# Reading Data

- **Folder as a dataset**: Instead of enumerating each file, simply pass the path containing all the files. Spark assumes that every file in that folder is part of the same dataset.
Note: no data is transferred between machines when distributed files are read
- **Predefine a Schema**: either a small sample of the data or an explicit definition of the columns type as a named vector

Define the schema:

```r
spec_explicit &lt;- c(x = "character", y = "numeric")
spec_explicit
```

```
          x           y 
"character"   "numeric" 
```


Use it When reading the data in:

```r
spark_read_csv(sc, "data-csv/", columns = spec_with_r)
```

---

# Data in-Memory or as "virtual table"

When you read data in using Spark with R: 

- Default: data is copied into Spark’s distributed memory

- Spark can also just "map" the files without copying data into memory 

_=&gt; The advantage of this method is that there is almost no up-front time cost to “reading” the file; the mapping is very fast._

_=&gt; The downside is that running queries that actually extract data will take longer._

This is controlled by the memory argument:


```r
mapped_csv &lt;- spark_read_csv(sc, "data-csv/", memory = FALSE)
```

Selecting a subset of column and caching it in-memory:


```r
mapped_csv %&gt;%
  dplyr::select(y) %&gt;%
  dplyr::compute("test")
```

---

# Writing Data

All efforts should be made to have reading, processing, and writing of data  happening within the same Spark session and not via R.

&lt;img src="data-recommended-approach-1.png" width="2789" /&gt;

What to do if the target is not within the Spark cluster?

- **Spark transfer**: Spark connects to the remote target location and copies the new data; Good if within same data center or cloud provider.
- **External transfer**: Spark writes query results as files  and then in the target location, you would use a separate process to transfer the data into the target location.

---

# Copying Data

`copy_to()` and `collect()` are good for data that fits into memory. Use the Hadoop command-line tool to manage such manipulation on large datasets. 

For the latter, you can use the _callback_ parameter to collect data larger that available memory.

**Generally, you should not need to worry about copying large datasets; instead, you can focus on reading and writing different file formats**


---

# Supported File Formats

Out of the box supported formats: 

&lt;img src="file-formats.png" width="2091" /&gt;

---

# CSV

Handling poorly formatted csv files:

- **Permissive**: Inserts NULL values for missing tokens
- **Drop Malformed**: Drops lines that are malformed
- **Fail Fast**: Aborts if it encounters any malformed line

---

# CSV - Example


```r
library(sparklyr)

sc &lt;- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3")

## Creates bad test file
writeLines(c("bad", 1, 2, 3, "broken"), "bad.csv")

spark_read_csv(
  sc,
  "bad3",
  "bad.csv",
  columns = list(foo = "integer"),
  options = list(mode = "PERMISSIVE"))
```

---

# JSON


```r
writeLines("{'a':1, 'b': {'f1': 2, 'f3': 3}}", "data.json")
simple_json &lt;- spark_read_json(sc, "data.json")
simple_json
```
To extract f1 you would run the following transformation:

```r
simple_json %&gt;% dplyr::transmute(z = get_json_object(to_json(b), 
                                                     '$.f1'))
```

Unnesting:

```r
sparklyr.nested::sdf_unnest(simple_json, "b")

spark_disconnect(sc)
```

---

# Apache Parquet


Parquet and ORC store data in columnar format, while AVRO is row-based. 

All of them are binary file formats, which reduces storage space and improves performance, but make them harder to read.

Spark makes their import pretty straight forward.



---

# Other formats

There is more

There are extension programs, called packages, that let you handle additional formats. 

- You need to load those packages when creating the connection
- `spark_read_source()` and `spark_write_source()` are the generic functions used to read and write those additional formats

Example:


```r
sc &lt;- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3", config = list(
  sparklyr.connect.packages = "com.databricks:spark-xml_2.11:0.5.0"))

writeLines("&lt;ROWS&gt;&lt;ROW&gt;&lt;text&gt;Hello World&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/ROW&gt;", "simple.xml")
spark_read_source(sc, "simple_xml", "simple.xml", "xml")

spark_disconnect(sc)
```

---

# File Systems

**Spark defaults to the file system on which it is currently running**.

- YARN managed cluster: the default file system will be HDFS
- Standalone: filesystem

However, the file system protocol can be changed when reading or writing. You will need the `sparklyr.connect.packages` spark package to configure this: 
 
 - filesystem: `_file://home/user/file.csv_`
 - Databricks: `_dbfs://_`
 - AWS: `_s3a://_`
 - MS Azure: `_wasb://_`
 - Google Cloud: `_gs://_`
 

```r
Sys.setenv(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = my_key_id)
Sys.setenv(AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = my_secret_key)

sc &lt;- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3", config = list(
  sparklyr.connect.packages = "org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:2.7.7"))

my_file &lt;- spark_read_csv(sc, "my-file", path = "s3a://my-bucket/my-file.csv")
```

---

# Storage Systems

Data lake and Spark usually go hand-in-hand, with optional access to storage systems like databases and data warehouses. 

Spark can push down computation to the database, a feature known as pushdown _predicates_, which improves performances.

Options:

- **Apache Hive**: data warehouse software natively well integrated in Spark
- **Apache Cassandra**: NoSQL database
- **JBDC**: interface for the programming language Java; when no packages exist for your specific connection

---

# Questions: Data Overview

1. Beyond big data, what can Spark helps with regarding data handling?
1. What does `Folder as a dataset` means?
1. How can a `schema` be leveraged in Spark when reading data?
1. List the file formats that spark can handle out of the box?
1. What is the name of extension programs you can use to add support of other file formats?
1. What is the general syntax to change the file format protocol when reading/writing files?

# Chapter 9: Tuning

It is often necessary to have some knowledge of the operations Spark runs internally to fine-tune configuration settings that will make computations run efficiently.

**Spark performs distributed computation by configuring, partitioning, executing, shuffling, caching, and serializing data, tasks, and resources across multiple machines:**

1. Configuring requests the cluster manager for resources: total machines, memory, and so on.
2. Partitioning splits the data among various machines. Partitions can be either implicit or explicit.
3. Executing means running an arbitrary transformation over each partition.
4. Shuffling redistributes data to the correct machine.
5. Caching preserves data in memory across different computation cycles.
6. Serializing transforms data to be sent over the network to other workers or back to the driver node.

---

# Example


```r
library(sparklyr)
library(dplyr)

sc &lt;- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3")

data &lt;- copy_to(sc, 
  data.frame(id = c(4, 9, 1, 8, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6)),
  repartition = 3)

data %&gt;% arrange(id) %&gt;% collect()
```

---

# Example

&lt;img src="tuning-spark-overview-resized.png" width="4000" /&gt;

---

# Graph &amp; Timeline

Spark describes all computation steps using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

**All computations in Spark move computation forward without repeating previous steps.**

=&gt; Makes Spark very efficient

To check the Graph:


```r
spark_web(sc)
```

Under `SQL` tab you can see the Graph

Under the `Jobs` tab you can both expand the graph and the event timeline

_Note: Mine looked slightly different than the book ones; standalone?_

---

# Configuring

The most common resources to configure are:
- Memory 
- Number of cores

Options:
- **Memory in driver**: The amount of memory required in the driver node
- **Memory per worker**: The amount of memory required in the worker nodes
- **Cores per worker**: The number of CPUs required in the worker nodes
- **Number of workers**: The number of workers required for this session

**Note: It is recommended to request significantly more memory for the driver than the memory available over each worker node. In most cases, you will want to request one core per worker.**

---

# Configuring Increasing Memory

In local mode there are no workers, but we can still configure memory and cores


```r
spark_disconnect(sc)

# Initialize configuration with defaults
config &lt;- spark_config()

# Memory
config["sparklyr.shell.driver-memory"] &lt;- "4g"

# Cores
config["sparklyr.connect.cores.local"] &lt;- 4

# Connect to local cluster with custom configuration
sc &lt;- spark_connect(master = "local", config = config)

data &lt;- copy_to(sc, 
  data.frame(id = c(4, 9, 1, 8, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6)),
  repartition = 3)

data %&gt;% arrange(id) %&gt;% collect()
```

---

# Configuring

There is a long list of settings you can customize. Note specific settings need to be define at different steps of the workflow:

- Connect settings
- Submit settings
- Runtime settings
- Sparklyr settings

---

# Partitioning

Partition: subset of the data available for computation over each compute instance

2 types:

- Implicit: the default; always on
- Explicit: When you want to control the number of partitions used


```r
knitr::include_graphics("tuning-partition-explicit.png")
```

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="tuning-partition-explicit.png" alt="Using 2 partitions is almost as fast at 1." width="4000" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Using 2 partitions is almost as fast at 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Using 2 partitions is almost as fast at 1.

---

# Caching

**Spark resilient distributed dataset (RDD)**: Distribute copies of data across the memory of many machines.

Most of `sparklyr` operations that retrieve a Spark DataFrame cache the results in memory.

You can explicitly control when an RDD is loaded or unloaded from memory using `tbl_cache()` and `tbl_uncache()`

Reminder: You can check what is cached on the Spark web interface under the `Storage` tab!

**Checkpoints**: useful when the computational graph becomes complex and expensive to run. Save data to files such as CSV of Parquet.

---

# Caching Memory

As part of tuning execution, you can consider tweaking the amount of memory allocated for user, execution, and storage by creating a Spark connection with different values than the defaults provided in Spark.

Memory is split into 4 categories:
- Reserved memory: memory Spark needs to function and therefore is overhead that is required and should not be configured. This value defaults to 300 MB
- **User memory**: memory used to execute custom code. `sparklyr` makes use of this memory only indirectly when executing dplyr expressions or modeling a dataset.
- **Execution memory**: memory to execute code by Spark, mostly to process the results from the partition and perform shuffling.
- **Storage memory**: used to cache RDDs—for instance, when using compute() in sparklyr

_Note: Spark will borrow execution memory from storage and vice versa if needed and if possible; therefore, in practice, there should be little need to tune the memory settings._

---

# Shuffling

**Shuffling is the operation that redistributes data across machines; it is usually expensive and therefore something you should try to minimize.** You can use the event timeline to determine if shuffling is significant or not in your analysis.

As example, when joining DataFrames you can use `sdf_broadcast()` to mark a DataFrame as small enough for use in broadcast joins

---

# Serialization

**Serialization is the process of translating data and tasks into a format that can be transmitted between machines and reconstructed on the receiving end.**

It is not that common to need to adjust serialization when tuning Spark.

---

# Configuration Files

Once you have find your optimization parameters, you can store them in a `config.yml` file to be stored in your current working directory.

config.yml:

```
default:
  sparklyr.shell.driver-memory: 2G
```

Then to connect, you can simply do: 


```r
sc &lt;- spark_connect(master = "local")
```
