## Chapter 1

Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.

â€” spark.apache.org

To help us understand this definition of Apache Spark, we break it down as follows:

Unified
Spark supports many libraries, cluster technologies, and storage systems.
Analytics
Analytics is the discovery and interpretation of data to produce and communicate information.
Engine
Spark is expected to be efficient and generic.
Large-Scale
You can interpret large-scale as cluster-scale, a set of connected computers working together.

```{r chapter1, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Chapter 2

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r chapter2}
# install.packages("sparklyr")
library(sparklyr)
packageVersion("sparklyr")
# spark_install()
spark_installed_versions()
spark_available_versions()
# library(sparklyr)

sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.4.3")


```



## Chapter 3

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r chapter3, echo=FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
# install.packages("rtools")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("corrr")
install.packages("dbplot")
install.packages("rmarkdown")

```

```{r}
# library(sparklyr)
library(dplyr)


```

```{r}
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.4.3")

```

```{r wrangle}
cars <- copy_to(sc, mtcars)
```

```{r summarize}
summarise_all(cars, mean)

```

```{r model}
cars %>% 
  ml_linear_regression(mpg ~ .) %>% 
  summary()

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
